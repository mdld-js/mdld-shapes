# Has Value {=sh:hasValue .class:Constraint label} Demo

## Demo {=ex:demo ?cat:hasDemo}

### Shapes

The **System Status Test Shape** {=ex:SystemStatusTestShape .sh:NodeShape ?cat:hasShape label} validates all [member] {+member ?sh:targetObjectsOf} entities of the test data container to demonstrate hasValue constraints for mandatory system properties with **Status Required Rule** {+ex:#statusRequired ?sh:property} and **Environment Required Rule** {+ex:#environmentRequired ?sh:property}.

### Rules

**Main server must have active status** {=ex:#statusRequired .sh:PropertyShape sh:message} requires the [status] {+ex:status ?sh:path} property to be exactly [active] {sh:hasValue}.

**Main server must be in production environment** {=ex:#environmentRequired .sh:PropertyShape sh:message} that requires the [environment] {+ex:environment ?sh:path} property to be exactly [production] {sh:hasValue}.

{=ex:demo}

### 📋 Test Data {=ex:data .Container}

#### Main Server {=ex:MainServer ?member}

The primary production server that must meet all requirements.

Status: [active] {ex:status}
Environment: [production] {ex:environment}
Version: [1.2.3] {ex:version}

#### Backup Server {=ex:BackupServer ?member}

A secondary server that fails status requirement.

Status: [standby] {ex:status}
Environment: [production] {ex:environment}
Version: [1.2.3] {ex:version}

#### Development Server {=ex:DevelopmentServer ?member}

A dev server that fails environment requirement.

Status: [active] {ex:status}
Environment: [development] {ex:environment}
Version: [1.2.4] {ex:version}

---

{=ex:demo} must produce exactly **2** {cat:expectsViolations ^^xsd:integer} violations.

### Expected Validation Results {=ex:results ?cat:hasResults}

1. **Main Server** - passes (has active status AND production environment)
2. **Backup Server** - fails once (status is standby, not active)
3. **Development Server** - fails once (environment is development, not production)

Note: Container member targeting with proper member annotations ensures all servers are validated. HasValue constraints enforce exact value matches for mandatory properties.

### 🔍 Test Validation

```bash
# This should show 2 violations - status and environment failures
ig-cli validate ./constraints/hasvalue.md
```
