# Deactivated Constraint {=sh:deactivated .class:DeactivatedConstraint label} Demo

## Demo {=ex:demo ?cat:hasDemo}

This demo demonstrates deactivated constraint using user account validation.

### Shape

The **Deactivated Example Shape** {=ex:DeactivatedExampleShape .sh:NodeShape ?cat:hasShape label} targets [Valid Node] {+ex:ValidNode ?sh:targetNode}  [Invalid Node] {+ex:InvalidNode  ?sh:targetNode} to validate user account properties with **Active Status Rule** {+ex:ActiveProperty ?sh:property label} and **Deactivated Category Rule** {+ex:DeactivatedProperty ?sh:property label} 

### Rules

**User status must be active** {=ex:ActiveProperty .sh:PropertyShape sh:message}: [status] {+ex:status ?sh:path} must be [active] {sh:hasValue}.

**Must have premium category** {=ex:DeactivatedProperty .sh:PropertyShape sh:message}: [category] {+ex:category ?sh:path} is always [premium] {sh:hasValue}. Was temporarily [deactivated] {sh:deactivated}.

### 📋 Test Data {=ex:data .Container}

#### Valid Account {=ex:ValidNode}

Account with active status (satisfies active rule).

Status: [active] {ex:status}
Category: [basic] {ex:category}  # Would violate category rule but it's deactivated

#### Invalid Account {=ex:InvalidNode}

Account with inactive status (violates active rule).

Status: [inactive] {ex:status}  # Violates active rule
Category: [basic] {ex:category}  # Would violate category rule but it's deactivated

---

[This demo] {=ex:demo} must produce exactly **1** {cat:expectsViolations ^^xsd:integer} violation.

### Expected Validation Results {=ex:results ?cat:hasResults}

1. **Valid Account** - passes (status is "active" ✓, category rule deactivated ✓)
2. **Invalid Account** - fails once (status is "inactive" ✗, category rule deactivated ✓)

### 🔍 Test Validation

```bash
# This should show 1 violation - only from active status rule
ig-cli validate ./constraints/deactivated.md
```
