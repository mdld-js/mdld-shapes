# Minimum Inclusive {=sh:minInclusive .class:Constraint label} Demo

## Demo {=ex:demo ?cat:hasDemo}

### Event Management Test Shape {=ex:EventTestShape .sh:NodeShape ?cat:hasShape label}

Validates all [member] {+member ?sh:targetObjectsOf} entities of the test data container to demonstrate comprehensive range constraints across multiple datatypes for event management scenarios. It includes **Ticket Price Range Rule** {+ex:#priceRange ?sh:property label}, **Attendee Age Restriction Rule** {+ex:#ageRange ?sh:property label}, **Event Scheduling Window Rule** {+ex:#eventDate ?sh:property label} and **Registration Deadline Rule** {=ex:#registrationDeadline ?sh:property label}.

### Rules

**Event ticket prices must be between $10.00 and $1000.00 inclusive for fair pricing** {=ex:#priceRange .sh:PropertyShape sh:message} - [ticketPrice] {+ex:price ?sh:path} property follows standard event pricing guidelines by being at least [10.00] {sh:minInclusive ^^xsd:decimal} (minimum viable ticket price) and at most [1000.00] {sh:maxInclusive ^^xsd:decimal} (premium event cap).

**Event attendees must be strictly between 18 and 65 years old for age-restricted events** {=ex:#ageRange .sh:PropertyShape sh:message} - legal and safety requirements by requiring the [attendeeAge] {+ex:age ?sh:path} property to be greater than [18] {sh:minExclusive ^^xsd:integer} (legal adult age) and less than [65] {sh:maxExclusive ^^xsd:integer} (senior discount eligibility).

**Events must be scheduled within the 2024-2025 planning period for proper resource allocation** {=ex:#eventDate .sh:PropertyShape sh:message} - the [eventDate] {+ex:eventDate ?sh:path} property falls within the current planning cycle by being at least [2024-01-01] {sh:minInclusive ^^xsd:date} (start of fiscal year) and at most [2025-12-31] {sh:maxInclusive ^^xsd:date} (end of planning horizon).

**Registration deadlines must be set after December 31, 2024 to allow adequate preparation time** {=ex:#registrationDeadline .sh:PropertyShape sh:message} - proper advance planning by requiring the [registrationDeadline] {+ex:registrationDeadline ?sh:path} property to be greater than [2024-12-31T23:59:59Z] {sh:minExclusive ^^xsd:dateTime} (end of current year).

{=ex:demo} must produce exactly **7** {cat:expectsViolations ^^xsd:integer} violations.

### Expected Validation Results {=ex:results ?cat:hasResults}

1. **Valid Event** - passes (all range constraints satisfied)
2. **Invalid Event - Price Too Low** - fails once (price: 5.99 < 10.00 minInclusive)
3. **Invalid Event - Price Too High** - fails once (price: 1500.00 > 1000.00 maxInclusive)
4. **Invalid Event - Age Too Young** - fails once (age: 18 = 18 minExclusive)
5. **Invalid Event - Age Too Old** - fails once (age: 65 = 65 maxExclusive)
6. **Invalid Event - Date Too Early** - fails once (date: 2023-12-31 < 2024-01-01 minInclusive)
7. **Invalid Event - Date Too Late** - fails once (date: 2026-01-01 > 2025-12-31 maxInclusive)
8. **Invalid Event - Deadline Too Early** - fails once (deadline: 2024-12-31T23:59:59Z = 2024-12-31T23:59:59Z minExclusive)

Note: Inclusive bounds (minInclusive, maxInclusive) include the boundary values, while exclusive bounds (minExclusive, maxExclusive) exclude the boundary values. Range constraints work with any ordered datatype including numbers, dates, times, and strings.

### 🔍 Test Validation

```bash
# This should show 7 violations - various range constraint failures across multiple datatypes
ig-cli validate ./constraints/range.md
```
