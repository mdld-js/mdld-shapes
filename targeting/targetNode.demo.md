# Target Node Demo {=ex:demo}

This demo demonstrates node-based targeting using critical infrastructure and executive validation scenarios.

## Critical Infrastructure Demo

The **Database Validation Shape** {=ex:DatabaseValidationShape .sh:NodeShape ?cat:hasShape label} targets the [Main Database] {+ex:MainDatabase ?sh:targetNode} for critical infrastructure validation: [status] {+#databaseStatus ?sh:property sh:name} and [uptime] {+#databaseUptime ?sh:property sh:name}.

**Main database must be online** {=#databaseStatus .sh:PropertyShape sh:message} requires the [status] {+ex:status ?sh:path} property to be exactly [online] {sh:hasValue}

**Database uptime must be at least 99.9%** {=#databaseUptime .sh:PropertyShapesh:message} that requires the [uptime] {+ex:uptime ?sh:path} property to be at least [99.9] {sh:minInclusive ^^xsd:decimal}

## Executive Validation Demo

**CEO Validation Shape** {=ex:CEOValidationShape .sh:NodeShape ?cat:hasShape label} targets the [CEO] {+ex:CEO ?sh:targetNode} for [executive] {+#executiveClearance ?sh:property sh:name} level clearance.

**CEO must have top-secret security clearance** {=#executiveClearance .sh:PropertyShape sh:message} requires the [securityClearance] {+ex:securityClearance ?sh:path} property to be exactly [top-secret] {sh:hasValue}.

## 📋 Test Data {=ex:data .Container}

### Main Database {=ex:MainDatabase}

Critical infrastructure that should be online with high uptime.

Status: [offline] {ex:status}
Uptime: [95.5] {ex:uptime ^^xsd:decimal}

### Backup Database {=ex:BackupDatabase}

Secondary infrastructure (not targeted by node-based validation).

Status: [online] {ex:status}
Uptime: [99.8] {ex:uptime ^^xsd:decimal}

### CEO {=ex:CEO}

The chief executive with proper clearance.

Security Clearance: [top-secret] {ex:securityClearance}

### CFO {=ex:CFO}

The chief financial officer (not targeted by CEO-specific validation).

Security Clearance: [secret] {ex:securityClearance}

---

[Demo] {=ex:demo} must produce exactly **3** {cat:expectsViolations ^^xsd:integer} violations.

## Expected Validation Results

1. **Main Database** - fails twice (status: offline ≠ online AND uptime: 95.5% < 99.9%)
2. **Backup Database** - not validated (not targeted by specific node validation)
3. **CEO** - passes (has top-secret clearance as required)
4. **CFO** - not validated (not targeted by CEO-specific validation)

Note: Node-based targeting provides precise control over which specific entities get validated, making it ideal for critical infrastructure and executive validation.

### 🔍 Test Validation

```bash
# This should show 3 violations - database status, uptime, and CEO clearance
ig-cli validate ./targeting/targetNode.md
```
